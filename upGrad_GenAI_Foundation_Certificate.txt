Notes:
Understanding Generative AI: The Layers
Artificial Intelligence (AI)

The broadest concept; machines performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.

Machine Learning (ML)

A subset of AI; machines learn how to identify patterns and make predictions from data.

Deep Learning (DL)

A subset of ML; uses layered neural networks to process vast amounts of data.

Generative AI (Gen AI)

A subset of DL; creates new content (text, images, audio, and video) based on learned patterns.
=======================================================
Prompt > Tokens > Self attention > Transformers > LLM large language model

from prompt
broken them with tokens tagging them with embeddings
and passing them through a neural network
along the way, transformers analyzed relationships between words using self attention
while the LLM leveraged its vast knowledge to generate a coherent, accurate response
==========================================================
Notes:
Generative AI Express: From Prompt to Answer
1. The Prompt

Your instruction or question to the AI begins the process.

2. Tokens

The prompt is broken down into tokens (small pieces of information such as words or parts of words).

3. Embeddings

Embeddings add context and meaning to each token—like detailed tags.

4. Neural Network

The AI explores possible connections and outputs using the neural network, which acts like railway switches.

5. Self-Attention

The model identifies relationships between tokens—tokens can “talk” to each other.

6. Transformers

Transformers handle self-attention, focusing on the most relevant connections for generating a response.

7. Large Language Model (LLM)

The model, trained with vast amounts of text, selects the best path using patterns learned from data.

8. The Answer (Endpoint)

The AI outputs the most probable answer based on the sequences and connections made:
Example: “The capital of France is Paris.”

This flow explains how a generative AI system processes a user prompt into a meaningful answer, step by step, using advanced neural networks and language models.
===============================================================

AI learning techniques
-----------------------
1. Foundational techniques -> ELI5, Role based learning
2. Advanced Learning Strategies -> Feynman Technique,  Socratic Questiong
Start as Broad, deeper

Concept of "AI for Simplifying Complex Topics"
It lists several techniques used for simplification, ordered from outermost to innermost circle:
Confusion/Complexity
ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)
Role-Based
Feynman Technique
Socratic Questioning0
These techniques are visually arranged to indicate a progression from confusion toward clarity in understanding complex subjects.

ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)
"Software testing means checking if a computer program works without mistakes, like making sure a game doesn't freeze when you play it.

Role-Playing Explanation
As a Scientist: "Testing is conducting experiments on software to see what errors appear and why."
As a Business Leader: "Testing ensures the software is reliable before customers use it, protecting the company’s reputation.

Feynman Technique (Teach to Learn)
Tester explains regression testing: "It checks that new changes haven’t broken old features." AI asks, "How do you know which old features to check?" Tester: "We use test cases for all critical functions."​

Socratic Questioning (Deep Dive)
Q: "Why do we need test automation?"
A: "It saves time testing repetitive tasks."
Q: "What risks are there if automation scripts are not maintained?"
A: "They may miss new bugs or fail if the UI changes.
Analogy Generator (Relatable Comparisons)
"Manual testing is like checking every door and window in a building by hand; automated testing is like having sensors that alert you if any door doesn’t close."

Beginner's Mind (Start Fresh)
"Testing means running a program to see how it behaves. Critical terms: bug (a mistake), test case (a detailed check), and validation (does it work as expected?).

Jargon Buster (Plain English)
"A smoke test is a quick check to see if the most basic parts of an app work, like turning on a phone to see if it powers up."

Step-by-Step Breakdown
How a Bug Report Gets Created:
Tester finds a mistake.
Describes what happened.
Developer reads and fixes the mistake.
Tester checks again to see if it’s fixed.

Real-World Example
Three ways QA testing happens:
Automated tests run for every new update to a banking app.
Manual testers click through each web page looking for layout errors.
Performance testers measure how fast a travel booking site loads under heavy traffic.

Misconception Identifier
Common QA misconceptions:
"Testing is only about finding bugs." (It also checks usability, security, and performance.)
"Only testers test; developers don’t need to." (Developers do unit testing.)
"Automated testing finds every bug." (Some bugs only appear during manual exploration.)

3. Interactive Learning Methods -> COncept Mapping, Spaced Repetition
4. Creative Learning Approaches -> Storytelling Method, Multimodal Learning
5. Practical Applications -> Project-Based Learning, Real-World Integration
6. Assesment Strategies -> Knowledge Testing, Progress Tracking

Concept Mapper (Visual Overview)
Create a concept map for a topic, showing main ideas, details, and how they connect.
Example: For "Software Testing," include nodes for unit testing, integration, automation, and link them to tools and benefits.
Useful when you need a big-picture understanding of relationships.

Spaced Repetition Scheduler (Memory Booster)
Develop a review schedule using the forgetting curve (e.g., review after 1 day, 3 days, 1 week).
Example: Plan to review JavaScript basics, then functions, then advanced topics, each at increasing intervals, adding flashcards and questions.
Best for long-term retention and reinforcement.

Storyteller (Engaging Narrative)
Turn a topic into a story with characters, plot, and analogies.
Example: Explain computer networks as a postal delivery service with message carriers, post offices, and delivery routes.
Makes abstract topics memorable.

Multimodal Explorer (Sensory Learning)
Suggest learning activities for visual, auditory, and kinesthetic senses.
Example: Visual: Draw a flowchart; Auditory: Listen to a podcast; Kinesthetic: Build a simple model.
Good for reinforcing concepts using multiple senses.

Project Planner (Hands-On Application)
Design a project to apply the topic, including goals, steps, and pitfalls.
Example: Build and test a basic website, plan stages, gather resources, track challenges, and avoid scope creep.
Ideal for practical, real-world learning.

Data Detective: USing AI for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-------------------------------------------------------
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with AI as shown in the image:

Understand the Basics
Before delving deep into the data, start by computing basic descriptive statistics such as mean and median. This foundational step provides a summary of the dataset’s central tendencies and variability, helping to establish a general sense of the data and highlight any unusual values that may require further investigation.

Find Patterns
Analyze the data to uncover trends, relationships, and anomalies. This involves identifying underlying structures, connections between variables, and any deviations that might indicate special cases or errors. Pattern recognition helps in understanding data distribution and prepares the groundwork for deeper analysis.

Visualize
Use charts and graphs to represent data visually. Visualization makes it easier to detect patterns, relationships, and trends, and to communicate insights effectively. Creating visual stories from the raw data is essential to make findings clear and accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences.

Formulate Hypotheses
Based on insights gained from the analysis and visualizations, develop initial hypotheses. These hypotheses form the basis for further investigation, testing, and validation as part of the analytical workflow. Hypothesis formulation is a critical step that leads to actionable data-driven decisions.

===================================================================================================================================

From Data to Story: Tailoring Your Narrative
----------------------------------------------
A compelling data story connects emotionally, making data meaningful and prompting action.
Adapting a narrative to suit its audience increases the story’s impact and memorability.
