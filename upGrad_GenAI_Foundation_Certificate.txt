Mastering Generative AI and Advanced Promting
GenAI - type of AI that creates entirely new things

GenAI is not perfect, which creates answers with confident but facts are wrong, then it's a AI hallucination

=======================================================
Notes:
Understanding Generative AI: The Layers
Artificial Intelligence (AI)

The broadest concept; machines performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.

Machine Learning (ML)

A subset of AI; machines learn how to identify patterns and make predictions from data.

Deep Learning (DL)

A subset of ML; uses layered neural networks to process vast amounts of data.

Generative AI (Gen AI)

A subset of DL; creates new content (text, images, audio, and video) based on learned patterns.
=======================================================
Prompt > Tokens > Self attention > Transformers > LLM large language model

from prompt
broken them with tokens tagging them with embeddings
and passing them through a neural network
along the way, transformers analyzed relationships between words using self attention
while the LLM leveraged its vast knowledge to generate a coherent, accurate response
==========================================================
Notes:
Generative AI Express: From Prompt to Answer
1. The Prompt

Your instruction or question to the AI begins the process.

2. Tokens

The prompt is broken down into tokens (small pieces of information such as words or parts of words).

3. Embeddings

Embeddings add context and meaning to each token—like detailed tags.

4. Neural Network

The AI explores possible connections and outputs using the neural network, which acts like railway switches.

5. Self-Attention

The model identifies relationships between tokens—tokens can “talk” to each other.

6. Transformers

Transformers handle self-attention, focusing on the most relevant connections for generating a response.

7. Large Language Model (LLM)

The model, trained with vast amounts of text, selects the best path using patterns learned from data.

8. The Answer (Endpoint)

The AI outputs the most probable answer based on the sequences and connections made:
Example: “The capital of France is Paris.”

This flow explains how a generative AI system processes a user prompt into a meaningful answer, step by step, using advanced neural networks and language models.
===============================================================
PROMPT acronym
P - Purpose - Specify AI achievement, clarify prompt goal, State desired AI action
R - Role - Define AI persona, choose AI role, Roles focus AI responses
O - Output - Specify AI response structure, Define desired format, Request specific output type
M - Markers - Set Ai guidelines, Define essential criteria, Establish AI requirements
P - Patterns - Provide AI templates, Offer examples, Guide AI with patterns
T - Tone - Define AI voice, Specify desired style, Set tone for AI

=============================================================
Aspect		Zero-shot	Few-shot	Chain-of-thought
Purpose		✔		✔		✔
Role		Optional	Optional	Optional
Output		✔		✔		✔
Markers		✔		✔		✔
Patterns	✖		✔		Sometimes
Tone		Optional	Optional	Optional

When to use 
Zero-shot prompt -
Quick answers, creative ideas, tasks relying on general knowledge

Few-shot prompt - 
Tasks requiring a specific style or format, more specialized knowledge
never provide confusing examples while providing the prompts it's as a part of patterns AI will get confused.

Chain-of-thought prompting

================================================================
Notes:

Zero-shot prompting
Description: Leverages existing AI knowledge
Benefits: Speed and efficiency

Few-shot prompting
Description: Teaches AI through examples
Benefits: Customization and accuracy

Chain-of-Thought prompting
Description: Enables logical deduction and problem-solving
Benefits: Reasoned, transparent, and logical outputs

AI for Research, Learning and Content Creation
===============================================
AI:
- Speeds up analysis
- Understands and writes like humans
- Summaries and simplifies
- Visulizes data

AI limitations: Verify AI outputs
Data Privacy & Security: Protect sensitive information
Ethics: Use AI responsibly

============================================================================================================
Pareto Principle or 80/20 principle
- result of 80% achieved from 20% of effort
- other of other 20% achieved from 80% of effort

Ex. prompt: Summarize the text highlight the 20% of information that contributes to 80% of key insights

Differnt types of summaries
One-sentence summary
Methodology focus
Audience specific summaries
Source -referneced summaries : Factual summary verification

Pitfalls of AI
Biased or inaccurate results
Knowledge limited to training data
Doouble check the information
